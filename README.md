### App Idea
### Simply Learn
Simply Learn is a mobile extension of the Learn System Solutions desktop platform, designed to streamline academic planning for college students. The app allows students to plan their semester schedules ahead of time using the registrar’s proposed class list, ensuring there are no time conflicts and that all courses align with their declared academic major/concentration. It will also keep track of past semester work and schedules.

- Builds optimized class timetables ahead of registration, preventing conflicts and helping students stay on track with their degree path.  
- Notifies students of upcoming classes, assignments, and exams, reducing the chance of missed deadlines or confusion.  
- Provides key information about professors, such as contact details, office hours, and course policies, all in one place.  
- Enables students to share and access study materials, notes, and files—both from peers and Brightspace—in a central hub.  
- Incorporates gamified elements like rewards, streaks, and usage challenges to encourage continuous engagement with the app.
